# vanity-rage

A mildly more performant Rust reimplementation of [vanity-age](https://github.com/6e6f61/vanity-age).


# Installation

```sh
git clone https://git.tebibyte.media/silt/vanity-rage.git
cd vanity-rage
cargo build --release
target/release/vanity-rage query
```


# Query Syntax

A query is just a normal glob, nothing to see here. Take a look at [glob-match](https://github.com/devongovett/glob-match)'s README for more info.
